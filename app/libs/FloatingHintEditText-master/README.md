FloatingHintEditText
====================
An EditText whose hint is always visible. When the text is non-empty, the hint is shrunk and positioned above the text.

Quick video demo [here][1].

This implementation extends EditText directly, so you can substitute FloatingHintEditText for your existing EditTexts and things should Just Work (TM). No container layouts required.
